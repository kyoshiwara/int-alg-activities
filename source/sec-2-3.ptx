  <title>Algebraic Solution of Systems</title>


<commentary audience="instructor"><title>Overview</title>
<p>This Lesson is a review of material from elementary algebra: solving systems by substitution and elimination. We try to avoid artificial applications such as coin and age problems, considering instead weighted averages, which include mixture and interest problems. Finding the equilibrium price for supply and demand equations, and the break-even point from cost and revenue are also included.</p></commentary>

<activity><title>Interest Problems</title>

<introduction><p>Carmella has $1200 invested in two stocks; one earns 8% per year and the other earns 12% per year. The income from the 8% stock is $3 more than the income from the 12% stock. How much did she invest in each stock?</p></introduction>

            <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
            <p>Emphasize that there are two types of money in this problem: the amount invested (principal) and the amount earned (interest).</p></commentary>

<task><p>Choose variables for the two unknown quantities, and fill in the table.</p>

            <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
            <p>Students typically have trouble with the interest equation: which side of the equation do we add $3 to? Write out the English sentence and translate phrase by phrase. Point out that if we add $3 to the larger side, the two sides cannot be equal!</p></commentary>

<task><p>Solve the system and answer the question in the problem.</p></task>

<activity><title>Mixture Problems</title>

<introduction><p>Amal plans to make 10 liters of a 17% acid solution by mixing a 20% acid solution with a 15% acid solution. How much of each should she use?</p></introduction>

            <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
            <p>Many students still believe that we can add percents, even of different amounts. Try this example: If you have two jars of red and blue marbles, each of which is 50% red marbles, and you pour both jars into a larger jar, will the result be 100% red marbles?</p></commentary>

<task><p>Write one equation about the amount of solution Amal needs.</p></task>

<task><p>Write a second equation about the amount of acid in the solutions.</p></task>

<activity><title>Motion Problems</title>
<introduction><p>Because of prevailing winds a flight from Detroit to Denver, a distance of 1120 miles, takes 4 hours on Econoflite, while the return trip takes 3.5 hours.  What were the speed of the airplane and the speed of the wind?</p></introduction>
