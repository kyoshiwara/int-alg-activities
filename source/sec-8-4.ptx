<p>In this lesson we simplify complex fractions and perform polynomial division.</p></commentary>

<activity><title>Complex Fractions</title>

<task><p>What is a complex fraction?</p>  
<p>To simplify a complex fraction:</p>
<p><ol>
<li><p></p></li>
<li><p></p></li>
<li><p></p></li>
</ol></p></task>

          <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
          <p>Explain to the class that a complex fraction is actually a division problem in which we first have to simplify numerator and denominator -- a long process that can be made easier with the "short-cut" of multiplying top and bottom by the LCD. Demonstrate with an easy numerical example that we get the same answer with both methods.</p></commentary>

<task><p>Follow the steps to simplify <m>~~~\dfrac{\dfrac{2}{y}+\dfrac{1}{2y}}{y +\dfrac{y}{2}}</m></p>
  <p><ol>
    <li><p>Find the LCD for <m>\dfrac{2}{y},~ \dfrac{1}{2y},~\dfrac{y}{1}~</m> and <m>~\dfrac{y}{2}</m>.
          <me>LCD = ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</me></p></li>
    <li><p>Multiply each term of the top and each term of the bottom by the LCD:
        <me>\dfrac{\blert{\dfrac{2t}{1}} \cdot \dfrac{2}{y}+\dfrac{1}{2y} \cdot \blert{\dfrac{2t}{1}}}{\blert{\dfrac{2t}{1}} \cdot y +\dfrac{y}{2} \cdot \blert{\dfrac{2t}{1}}} </me></p></li> 

          <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
          <p>Emphasize that we must multiply each term of top and bottom by the same LCD. We are not using a building factor in this procedure.</p></commentary>
                                           
      <li><p>Reduce:</p></li>
  </ol></p></task>

          <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
          <p>Of course, students will now confuse the rules for simplifying complex fractions with the rules for adding fractions. It is a good idea to compare the two procedures on similar examples, say, adding <m>\dfrac{2}{x} + \dfrac{1}{x-2}</m>  and simplifying <m>\dfrac{1+\dfrac{1}{x-2}}{1-\dfrac{2}{x}}</m>.</p></commentary>

<task><p>Sometimes complex fractions are written with negative exponents. For example,
  <me>\dfrac{x^{-1}-y}{x^{-1}} = \dfrac{\dfrac{1}{x} - y}{\dfrac{1}{x}}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</me>
Simplify this complex fraction.</p></task>

<activity><title>Application</title>

<introduction><p>The owner of a print shop volunteers to produce flyers for his candidate's campaign. His large printing press can complete the job in 4 hours, and the smaller model can finish the flyers in 6 hours. How long will it take to print the flyers if he runs both presses simultaneously?</p></introduction>

          <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
          <p>These rate problems are quite hard for students. Part 1 of the Activity illustrates the logic with a numerical example; refer to the steps of Part 1 as you work through the general version in Part 2.</p></commentary>

<task><p>Part (1):  Write fractions of the job can each press can complete in 1 hour.</p>
    <p>Large press:</p>
    <p>Small press:</p></task>

<task><p> What fraction of the job can be completed in 1 hour with both presses running simultaneously?</p></task>

<task><p>How long will it take to complete the job with both presses running?</p></task>

<task><p>Part (2): Now we'll try the same problem with variables. Suppose that the large press can complete a job in <m>t_1</m> hours and the smaller press takes <m>t_1</m> hours.  (Use your answers above as a guide.)</p>
<p>Write expressions for the fraction of a job that each press can complete in 1 hour.(Use your answers to Part (1) as a guide.)</p>
    <p>Large press:</p>
    <p>Small press:</p></task>

<task><p>Write an expression for the fraction of a job that can be completed in 1 hour with both presses running simultaneously.</p></task>

<task><p>Write a complex fraction for the time needed to complete the job with both presses running.</p></task>

<task><p>Write your complex fraction as a simple fraction.</p></task>

<task><p>Use your formula to verify your answer to Part (1).</p></task>
</activity>

<activity><title>Polynomial Division</title>

<introduction><p>If an algebraic fraction cannot be reduced, we can simplify it by dividing the denominator into the numerator.</p></introduction>

<task><p>Monomial divisor. Divide the monomial into each term of the numerator.</p>
<p><m>~~~\dfrac{2m^6-15m^4+7}{-5m^3}</m></p></task>

<task><p>Binomial divisor. We follow the procedure for long division. First, prepare the fraction:</p>

  <p>Write the fraction  <m>\dfrac{\text{numerator}}{\text{denominator}}</m>  this way:    denominator )\overline{numerator}</p>

  <p>So the denominator becomes the divisor. Write both polynomials in descending powers of the variable, and insert terms with  coefficient 0 if any powers are missing.</p></task>

            <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
            <p>Students usually grumble at the length of polynomial division problems, but after the second or third example are comfortable with the process.</p></commentary>

<task><p>Divide  <m>~~~~\dfrac{2x^3 - 3x^2-2x+4}{x+1}</m></p></task>

<task><p>Divide  <m>~~~~\dfrac{7-3t^3-23t^2+10t^4}{2t+3}</m></p></task>

            <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
            <p>Point out that polynomial division is the algebraic analogue for converting an improper fraction to a mixed number.</p></commentary>
