  <title>Lesson 1.1 Linear Models</title>

<commentary audience="instructor"><title>Overview</title>
<p>Lesson 1.1 reviews some skills from elementary algebra in the context of applications: solving simple equations and inequalities, evaluating expressions, and graphing an equation by plotting points. We consider linear models of the form <m>y=</m> (starting value)<m>+</m>(rate of change)<m>\cdot x</m>.</p>
<p>It's a good idea to work through Lesson 1.1 for the class, so that they have a model to follow for future Lessons. Show students how you want them to record their work.</p>

    <introduction><p>In 2000, the average sea level, <m>L</m>, was 24 millimeters above normal, and it has been rising at a rate of 3 mm per year. </p></introduction>

    <statement>
      <task><p>Complete the table of values for the sea level <m>t</m> years after 2000.</p>

          <p>Graphs should extend across the entire grid, including any intercepts.</p></commentary>

      <p>To answer questions below, read the graph. Show your work on the graph:</p>
          <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
          <p>Have students draw dashed lines on the graph, as in Example 1.7.</p></commentary>

      <task><p>According to this model, what will the sea level be in 2020?</p></task> 

      <task><p>How long will it be before the sea level is 6 centimeters above average? (How many millimeters in 1 centimeter?)</p></task>
