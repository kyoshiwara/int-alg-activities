<activity><title>The Vertex Form</title>
<introduction><p>The batter in a softball game hits the ball when it is 4 feet above the ground. The ball reaches the greatest height, 35 feet, directly above the head of the left-fielder, who is 200 feet from home plate.</p></introduction>

<task><sidebyside widths="50% 30%"><p>The path of the ball is shown at right.  Label the <m>y</m>-intercept and the vertex with their coordinates.</p>
  <image source="act-4-2-1.png"></image></sidebyside></task>
<task><p>Write an equation for the height of the ball in terms of the horizontal distance it has traveled.</p></task> 
<task><p>Find the height of the ball when it reaches the left field wall, which is 375 feet from home plate.  If the wall is 10 feet tall, did the batter hit a home run (did the ball go over the wall)?</p></task>

<activity><title>Maximum or Minimum value</title>
<introduction><p>A farmer plans to fence a rectangular grazing area along a river using 300 yards of fence.</p></introduction>
<task><p>Draw a sketch illustrating the grazing area, and label its length and width.</p></task>

<activity><title>Revenue</title>
<introduction><p>The local theater group sold tickets to its opening night performance for $5 and drew an audience of 100 people. The next night they reduced the ticket price by $0.25 and 10 more people attended; that is, 110 people bought tickets at $4.75 apiece. In fact, for each $0.25 reduction in ticket price, 10 additional tickets can be sold.</p></introduction>
