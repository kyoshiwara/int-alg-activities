  <title>Linear Inequalities</title>

<commentary audience="instructor"><title>Overview</title>
<p>In this lesson we graph the solutions to linear inequalities in two variables, and to systems of linear inequalities. We also find the vertices of the solution set. These skills are used when solving two-dimensional optimization problems subject to a set of constraints.</p></commentary>

<activity><title> Graphing a Linear Inequality</title>

<introduction><p>How is an inequality in two variables different from an equation? How are the solutions different? How are their graphs different? (Remember that a graph is just a picture of all the solutions.)</p></introduction>

<task><p>Graph the solutions to the linear inequality    
    <me>3x - y \le -2</me></p>
<p>We begin by graphing the equation <m>3x - y = -2</m>. This line will be the boundary line for our solution set.</p> 
<p>Write the equation <m>3x - y = -2</m> in slope-intercept form.</p></task>

<task><sidebyside widths="40% 45%"><stack>
  <p>Use the slope-intercept method to graph the line.</p>
  <p><m>b = </m></p>
  <p><m>m = \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = </m></p></stack>
    <image source="act-2-5-2.png"></image></sidebyside></task>

<task><p>Next we'll use a test point to find out where the solutions of the inequality are. We can use any point for a test point, as long as it does not lie on the line! We'll use <m>(1,4)</m>. Locate this point on your graph. Use algebra to decide whether <m>(1,4)</m> is a solution of the inequality <m>3x - y \le -2</m>.</p></task>

<task><p>Which side of the line includes all the solutions of the inequality? Shade that side of the line. Is the line itself included in the solution set?</p></task>

<task><p>Can you suggest an easier test point instead of <m>(1,4)</m>?</p></task>   

<task><p>Graph the solutions to each inequality.</p>

<activity><title>Systems of Inequalities</title>

<introduction><p>To graph the solution set of a system, graph each inequality separately, one at a time. Shade each solution region lightly (or use different colors) so that you can see their intersection.</p></introduction>

      <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
      <p>It's important for students to complete the graph of each inequality in the system separately, before going on to the next one. Have students number the inequalities and label each boundary line with its number.</p></commentary>

<task><p>Outline the intersection of the four solution sets. Draw dots at the vertices, or corners, of the intersection region. (There are four vertices.)</p></task>

<activity><title>Finding the Vertices</title>

<task><p>Use a system of equations to find the coordinates of each of the vertices of the solution set above.</p> 

  <p>Intersection of Line 1 and Line 2:</p>

  <p>Intersection of Line 1 and Line 3:</p>

  <p>Intersection of Line 2 and Line 4:</p>

  <p>Intersection of Line 3 and Line 4:</p></task>

        <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
         <p>You may be surprised that many students cannot tell you how to find the intersection point of two lines.</p>
          <p>If students numbered the boundary lines in Activity 1, now they can identify quickly which pair of equations yields each vertex.</p></commentary>
