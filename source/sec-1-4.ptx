  <title>Slope</title>

<commentary audience="instructor"><title>Overview</title>
<p>This Lesson reviews the notion of slope, which students learned in elementary algebra, but emphasizes the meaning of the slope as a rate of change. Notice that in this Lesson we do not use the coordinate formula for slope, <m>y=\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</m>;  that formula is taken up in Lesson 1.5. All of the slopes in this Lesson can be computed from the definition, <m>m=\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}</m>. Encourage students to include units in their calculation of <m>\Delta y</m> and <m>\Delta x</m> to help them interpret the slope as a rate.</p>
<p>Two skills will probably be new to students:  deciding if data are linear by checking for constant slope, and using the slope to calculate either <m>\Delta y</m> or <m>\Delta x</m>, given a value for the other.</p></commentary>

<introduction><p>The taxi fare in three different cities is described below.  In each city, you pay an initial charge when you get into the taxi, and then your fare is based on the distance you travel.  Each city uses a different distance unit to compute the fare.

  <task><p>Compute the charge per mile in each city. (Do not include the initial charge.) In which city do taxis charge the highest mileage rate?</p></task>

            <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
            <p>To help students with part (a), ask: if 1/8 mile costs $0.30, how much would 1 mile cost? You can also point out that dividing $0.30 by 1/8 mile gives the same result as multiplying $0.30 by 8.</p></commentary>

  <task><p>Write a linear model for the taxi fare in each city, using miles as the input variable. (Hint: What is the initial value for each model?)</p></task>
            <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
            <p>Remind students of the form for a linear model. In this model the input variable is distance (miles), not time.</p></commentary>

  <task><p>In which city do taxis charge the lowest fare for a 5 mile ride?</p></task>

  <task><p>For what distance are the taxi fares in Boston and New York equal? (Hint: Use the appropriate models from part (b).)</p></task>

            <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
            <p>Students find part (d) difficult: they don't understand that the models in part (b) are expressions for the taxi fare.</p></commentary>

             <p>Many students will work out the answer using common sense. Show them how to use the definition of slope and solve an equation to get the same answer.</p></commentary>
