  <title>Linear Inequalities in Two Variables</title>

<activity><title>Solutions of Inequalities in Two Variables</title>
<introduction><p>How is an inequality in two variables different from an equation? How are the solutions different? How are their graphs different? (Remember that a graph is just a picture of all the solutions.) Compare the two scenarios below.</p></introduction>

<task><p>Ivana owns two hotels that earn annual profits of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> dollars, respectively. She would like her total annual profit from the two hotels to be (exactly) $10,000. Fill in the table with some possible values for <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, in thousands of dollars. Note that it is possible for one of the hotels to sustain a loss, or negative profit.</p>

<task><p>Explain how the graph of the equation in part (c) is different from the graph of the inequality in part (g).</p></task>  
<task><p>Describe the graph of the inequality. Note that all the solutions of the inequality lie on one side of the line.</p></task>

<activity><title>Graphing a Linear Inequality</title>
<introduction><p>Now we'll develop a technique for graphing the solutions of a linear inequality. As an example, we'll consider    
    <me>3x - y \le -2</me></p></introduction>

<task><p>We begin by graphing the equation <m>3x - y = -2</m>. This line will be the boundary line for our solution set.</p></task> 
<task><p>Write the equation <m>3x - y = -2</m> in slope-intercept form.</p></task>
<task><sidebyside widths="40% 50%"><stack>
  <p>Use the slope-intercept method to graph the line.</p>
  <p><m>b = </m></p>
  <p><m>m = \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = </m></p></stack>
    <image source="act-2-5-2.png"></image></sidebyside></task>

  <task><p>Next we'll use a test point to find out where the solutions of the inequality are. We can use any point for a test point, as long as it does not lie on the line! We'll use <m>(1,4)</m>.  Locate this point on your graph.  Use algebra to decide whether <m>(1,4)</m> is a solution of the inequality <m>3x - y \le -2</m>.</p></task>
  <task><p>Which side of the line includes all the solutions of the inequality? Shade that side of the line. Is the line itself included in the solution set?</p></task>
  <task><p>Can you suggest an easier test point instead of <m>(1,4)</m>?</p></task>
