  <title>Direct Variation</title>

<commentary audience="instructor"><title>Overview</title>
<p>In this Lesson we consider direct variation, as a precursor to the later study of power functions. We consider how to identify different forms of variation from a table, a graph, or an equation, and how to model applications with variation equations.</p></commentary> 

<activity><title>Constant of Variation</title>

            <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
            <p>As you work through the Activities, keep a record on the blackboard listing the properties of direct variation and direct variation with a power (for this course, the power is almost always two or at most three). Include how to recognize variation from a table of values, the form of the equation, and the shape of the graph.</p></commentary>

<task><p>Complete the statements about direct variation.</p>
  <p><ul>  
<li><p>Definition: <m>y</m> is proportional to <m>x</m>, or varies directly with <m>x</m>, if the ratio <m>\dfrac{y}{x}</m>
   is  <fillin/> .</p></li>
