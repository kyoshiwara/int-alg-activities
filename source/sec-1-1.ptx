  <title>Linear Models</title>

<commentary audience="instructor"><title>Overview</title>
<p>Lesson 1.1 reviews some skills from elementary algebra in the context of applications: solving simple equations and inequalities, evaluating expressions, and graphing an equation by plotting points. We consider linear models of the form <m>y=</m> (starting value)<m>+</m>(rate of change)<m>\cdot x</m>.</p>
<p>It's a good idea to work through Lesson 1.1 for the class, so that they have a model to follow for future Lessons. Show students how you want them to record their work.</p>

<activity><title>A Decreasing Graph</title>
    <p>Silver Lake has been polluted by industrial waste products. In 2000 the concentration of toxic chemicals in the water was 285 parts per million (ppm). Local environmental officials started a program to reduce the concentration by 15 ppm each year.</p>
