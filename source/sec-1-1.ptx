      <task>
    <p>In 2000, the average sea level, <m>L</m>, was 24 millimeters above normal, and it has been rising at a rate of 3 mm per year. </p>
    <p>Complete the table of values for the sea level <m>t</m> years after 2000.</p>

    <task><p>Write an equation for the sea level, <m>L</m>, in terms of <m>t</m>, the number of years since 2000.</p></task>

    <task><p>Graph the equation on the grid. Label the axes with the correct variables.</p>

      <p>To answer questions (d) and (e), read the graph. Show your work on the graph:</p></task>
    <task><p>According to this model, what will the sea level be in 2020?</p></task>  

    <task><p>How long will it be before the sea level is 6 centimeters above average? (How many millimeters in 1 centimeter?)</p></task>
      
    <task><p>Now use algebra to find the answers for parts (d) and (e) above. Compare your answers to the values you read from the graph.</p></task> 

    <task><p>Another global warming concern is rising temperature. Since 1950, the global mean temperature in degrees Celsius can be modeled by the equation
      <me>T = 13.9 + 0.13t</me> 
    where <m>t</m> is the number of years since 1950. What do the constants in this equation tell us about global temperature?</p>

    <p><m>13.9</m> tells us:</p>

    <p><m>0.13</m> tells us:</p></task></activity>

    <p>Silver Lake has been polluted by industrial waste products. In 2000 the concentration of toxic chemicals in the water was 285 parts per million (ppm). Local environmental officials started a program to reduce the concentration by 15 ppm each year.</p>
    <task><p>Complete the table of values showing the concentration, <m>C</m>, of toxic chemicals <m>t</m> years after 2000.  Then write your answers as ordered pairs.</p>

    <task>><p>In one or two complete sentences, explain why you should stop the graph at the horizontal axis.</p></task>

<task><p>Interpret the point <m>(16,45)</m> for this situation.  (Use complete sentences!)</p></task>

<task><p>Use the graph to find those years when the concentration will be below 120 ppm but above 30 ppm. Show your work on the graph.</p></task>

<subsection><title> Check Your Understanding</title><ol>
<li><p>In Activity 1b, you wrote an equation for sea level, <m>L</m>.  What was the starting value, and what was the rate?</p></li>
<li><p>In part (d) of Activity 1, did you evaluate an expression or solve an equation? </p></li> 
<li><p>In part (e) of Activity 1, you solved an equation by using the graph.  Did you start by locating the given value on the horizontal axis, or on the vertical axis? </p></li> 
<li><p>In Activity 2, which variable goes on the horizontal axis? </p></li>
<li><p>In part (e) of Activity 2, you solved an inequality.  On which axis did your answers appear?</p></li>

<p>In this Lesson, we worked on the following skills and goals related to linear models:</p>
<p><ul>
<li><p>Analyze linear models given by a description in words, by a graph, by a table of values, or by an equation.</p></li> 
<li><p>Write an equation for a linear model described in words, in the form:
     <me>y=\text{(starting value)} + \text{(rate)} \times t</me></p></li>
<li><p>Interpret an ordered pair of values for a linear model.</p></li> 
<li><p>Make a graph from a table of values by choosing appropriate scales for the axes and plotting points.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate an algebraic expression.</p></li>
