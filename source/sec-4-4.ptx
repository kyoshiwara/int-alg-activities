  <title>Quadratic Inequalities</title>

<commentary audience="instructor"><title>Overview</title>
<p>In this lesson we solve quadratic inequalities graphically and algebraically, and write their solutions with interval notation. Note that our algebraic technique uses properties of the parabola; we do not use a "sign graph" to solve inequalities.</p></commentary>

<introduction><p>Here are three copies of the graph of <m>~y=x^2-4</m>.</p>

            <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
            <p>You might want to preface this Activity by having students use trial and error to find solutions to  <m>~x^2-4 \lt 0</m>, and plot their solutions on a number line on the board. (Remind them to try both positive and negative values, and fractions.) Then do the same for <m>~x^2-4 \gt 0</m>.</p></commentary>

<task><p>On the first graph, we'll solve the equation <m>~x^2-4=0</m>. (Remember that <m>~y=x^2-4</m>.)</p>
  <p><ol>
  <li><p>Find two points on the graph with <m>y=0</m>. Put dots there.</p></li>
  <li><p>What are the <m>x</m>-coordinates of those points?</p></li>
  <li><p>The solutions are: </p></li>
  </ol></p></task> 

<task><p>On the second graph, we'll solve the inequality <m>~x^2-4 \lt 0</m>.</p>

            <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
            <p>Explain that because the graph shows points for which <m>~y=x^2-4</m>, the solutions to <m>~x^2-4 \lt 0</m> are just the <m>x</m>-coordinates of points on the graph with <m>y \lt 4</m>. You will need to go over this reasoning on every problem.</p></commentary>

  <p><ol>  
  <li><p>Mark all points on the graph that have <m>y \lt 0</m>.</p></li>
  <li><p>On the <m>x</m>-axis, mark the <m>x</m>-coordinates of all those points.</p></li>
  <li><p>Write an inequality to describe the portion of the <m>x</m>-axis marked.</p></li>
</ol></p></task>

<task><p>On the third graph, we'll solve the inequality <m>~x^2-4 \gt 0</m>.</p>   
  <p><ol>
  <li><p>Mark all points on the graph that have <m>y \gt 0</m>.</p></li>
  <li><p>On the <m>x</m>-axis, mark the <m>x</m>-coordinates of all those points.</p></li>
  <li><p>Write two inequalities to describe the portion of the <m>x</m>-axis marked.</p></li>

             <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
             <p>Emphasize that because the solution set consists of two intervals, we need two inequalities to describe it. Also explain why <m>-2 \gt x \gt 2</m>  is not correct.</p></commentary>

<activity><title>Solving Quadratic Inequalities Graphically</title>

<introduction><p>Here are two copies of the graph of <m>~y=175-18x-x^2~</m>.</p>
    <image source="act-4-4-2.png"></image></introduction>

<task><p>Use the first graph to solve of <m>~175-18x-x^2 = 0~</m>.</p>   
  <p>(Hint: Notice that one of the <m>x</m>-intercepts is <m>25</m>. Think of the factored form of the equation. What is the other factor?)
          <me>(x+25)(x- <fillin/>)=0</me></p></task>

          <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
          <p>Start using the language "between the <m>x</m>-intercepts or outside the <m>x</m>-intercepts" or something similar to describe the choice of which part of the <m>x</m>-axis provides the solutions.</p></commentary>

<task><p>Use the second graph to solve  <m>~175-18x-x^2 \lt 0~</m>.</p>
  <p><ol>
  <li><p>Mark all points on the graph that have <m>y \lt 0</m>.</p></li>
  <li><p>On the <m>x</m>-axis, mark the <m>x</m>-coordinates of all those points.</p></li>
  <li><p>Write two inequalities to describe the portion of the <m>x</m>-axis marked.</p></li>
</ol></p></task>

<task><p>Solve the inequality <m>~20+4x-x^2 \le 8</m>.</p>
  <p><ol>
    <li><p>Rewrite the inequality so that the right side is zero.</p></li>

            <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
            <p>This problem also provides an opportunity to review graphing a parabola by hand. Notice that the coefficient of <m>x^2</m> is negative, so expect some confusion about finding the <m>x</m>-intercepts versus finding the <m>x</m>-coordinate of the vertex.</p></commentary>

<activity><title>Solving Inequalities Algebraically</title>

<introduction><p>To solve a quadratic inequality,
    <me>ax^2+bx+c \lt 0~~~~\text{or}~~~~ax^2+bx+c \gt 0</me>
we must answer two questions:<ol>
  <li><p>What are the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the related graph?</p></li>
  <li><p>Does the parabola open up or down?</p></li></ol></p>
<p>Remember that you may need to use extraction of roots or the quadratic formula to find the <m>x</m>-intercepts of a parabola.</p>

          <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
          <p>Take a few minutes to give examples of interval notation. In this Lesson, we use <m>\union</m> to indicate the union of two intervals, but we do not discuss intersection of sets.</p></commentary>

            <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
            <p>Remind students that once we have found the <m>x</m>-intercepts as boundary points for our solution set, we only need to decide whether the solutions lie between the intercepts or outside them -- we don't need any other information about the parabola (such as the vertex). So we only need to know if the parabola opens up or down.</p></commentary>

            <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
            <p>Problems (c) and (d) point out that sometimes we have to use extraction of roots or the quadratic formula to find the <m>x</m>-intercepts.</p></commentary>

<subsection><title>Check Your Understanding</title>
<p><ol>
<li><p>In Activity 1, we saw that for any value of <m>x</m>, the value of <m>x^2-4</m> is either <fillin/>, <fillin/>, or <fillin/>.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose you have a point <m>P</m> with <m>y</m>-coordinate 8 on the graph of an equation. How do you find the <m>x</m>-value that produces <m>y=8</m> in the equation?</p></li>
<li><p>When you solve a quadratic inequality with a graph, how do you find the boundary points of the solution interval(s)?</p></li>
