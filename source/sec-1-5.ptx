  <title>Equations of Lines</title>

<commentary audience="instructor"><title>Overview</title>
<p>In this Lesson, the slope-intercept formula is treated very briefly. Students should have mastered the slope-intercept form in elementary algebra, and it has already appeared in this course as the form for a linear model. We also review the coordinate formula for slope, <m>m=\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</m>, and the notion of net change.</p>  

<p>The chief objective of this Lesson in the point-slope formula. Besides being able to use the formula, we want students to understand two ideas:</p>
<p>a.  The point-slope formula is really the same as the coordinate formula for slope, but used in a different way.</p>
<p>b.  We'd also like students to understand the syntax of the formula, i. e. starting at a point <m>(x_1,y_1)</m> and using the slope to find any other point on the line, rather than just memorizing it.</p>

<p>Students may have been taught to find a linear equation by substituting a point into the slope-intercept formula to find <m>b</m>, but at this stage it is important that they master the point-slope formula. Finding a linear equation to fit two points is one of the most useful skills they will learn in this course. Note that we give two alternate forms for the formula:  the fractional form, <m>\dfrac{y-y_1}{x-x_1} = m</m>, is easier for students if the slope is a common fraction. The form <m>y=y_1+m(x-x_1)</m>  captures the mechanics of the formula, and will occur in calculus.</p> 

<p>For students, the hardest part of using the formula in an application is identifying the two points to use. Encourage them to make a short table, starting by deciding which is the input variable and which is the output.</p></commentary>

<introduction><p>Sea water does not freeze at exactly 32 <m>\degree</m> F because of its salinity. The temperature at which water freezes depends on its dissolved mineral content. A common unit for measuring salinity is parts per thousand, or ppt. For example, salinity of 8 ppt means 8 grams of dissolved salts in each kilogram of water. Here are some data for the freezing temperature of water.
