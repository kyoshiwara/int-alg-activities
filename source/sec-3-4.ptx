  <title>Completing the Square</title>

<commentary audience="instructor"><title>Overview</title>
<p>This is a skills lesson on completing the square. You may want to begin by presenting a quadratic equation that cannot be solved by factoring. Explain that our goal is to turn any quadratic expression into a square of a binomial, so that we can then solve the equation by extraction of roots. It is also helpful to tell students that although the quadratic formula is usually faster than completing the square, we'll need this skill for other applications (conic sections) later on.</p></commentary>

<activity><title>Squares of Binomials</title>

            <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
            <p>Have students square several binomials and look for the pattern in the coefficients before presenting the formula for <m>(x+p)^2</m>. Leave the formula prominently displayed on the board; you will need to refer back to it often.</p></commentary>

<task><p>Write a formula for the square of a binomial:
        <me>(x+p)^2 = </me>
Notice that the constant term of the trinomial is  <fillin/> , and the coefficient of the linear term (or <m>x</m>-term) is <fillin/>.</p></task>

  <task><p> Now we'll reverse the process. Add a constant to the expression that will turn it into a perfect square:

    <me>x^2-16x+<fillin/> = (x <fillin/>)^2</me>                                

    (Do you see how to find the constant?  Here's what you do:)</p>
      <p>First find <m>p:~~~~~~~~~~~~~2p=-16</m>, so  <m>p=\frac{1}{2}(-16)=</m></p>
      <p>Then find <m>p^2:~~~~~~~~~~~~p^2=</m></p>  

              <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
              <p>Some students catch on quickly, but others have a hard time finding <m>p</m> and <m>p^2</m>. In particular, you will probably have to explain that if you know <m>2p</m>, you can find  by multiplying by <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> (and this is the same as dividing by 2.)</p></commentary>
  
  <p>We can turn any quadratic expression into a perfect square by adding the correct constant. This process is called <term>completing the square</term>.</p></task>

              <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
              <p>It may also help to write several quadratic trinomials on the board and ask students which are perfect squares (and then explain how you know.)</p></commentary>

<task><p>Complete the square and write the result as the square of a binomial.<ol>
    <li><p><m>x^2 + 18x + <fillin/> = </m></p></li>
    <li><p><m>x^2 - 14x + <fillin/> = </m></p></li></ol></p></task>

<task><p>For parts these problems, do not use a calculator!  Work with fractions.<ol>
    <li><p><m>x^2 + 3x + <fillin/> = </m></p></li>
    <li><p><m>x^2 - \dfrac{5}{2}x + <fillin/> = </m></p></li></ol></p></task>

<activity><title>Solving Quadratic Equations by Completing the Square</title>

<introduction><p>We use the technique of completing the square to solve quadratic equations.  There are two parts to this method:
<ol>
<li><p>Create a perfect square</p></li>
<li><p>Use extraction of roots</p></li></ol></p></introduction>

<task><p>Follow the steps to solve <m>~~x^2-6x-16=0</m></p>.

  <p>Move the constant term to the other side of the equation:
          <me>x^2-6x~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~=16</me></p>
  <p>Complete the square on the left side:   
        <me>p=\frac{1}{2}(-6)=<fillin/>~~~~\text{and}~~~~~p^2=(-3)^2=<fillin/></me></p>              
  <p>Add 9 to both sides of the equation:
        <me>x^2-6x+\alert{9} = 16+\alert{9}</me></p>
  <p>Write the left side as the square of a binomial: 
        <me>(<fillin/>)^2 = 25</me></p>                  
  <p>Use extraction of roots to find the solutions: take the square root of both sides.                   
        <md><mrow>x-3 \amp = <fillin/>~~~~\text{or}~~~~ x-3 = <fillin/></mrow>
            <mrow>  x \amp = <fillin/>~~~~\text{or}~~~~~~~~~~~ x = <fillin/></mrow></md></p>                                   
  <p>The solutions are <fillin/> and <fillin/>.</p>
</task>

    <image source="act-3-4-5.png"></image></sidebyside></task>

<task><p>Solve <m>~~x^2-8x-4=0~~</m> by completing the square. (This equation cannot be solved by factoring!)</p>

  <p>Move the constant term to the right side:</p>
  <p>Complete the square on the left side:  
        <me>p=\frac{1}{2}(-8)=<fillin/>~~~~\text{and}~~~~~p^2=<fillin/></me></p>                                            
  <p>Add <m>p^2</m> to both sides:</p>
  <p>Write the left side as the square of a binomial, and simplify the right side:</p>
  <p>Extract roots to obtain two solutions: </p>
  <p>Use a calculator to find decimal approximations for each solution. Round to thousandths:</p>

            <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
            <p>Be sure to go over finding decimal approximations on the calculator.</p></commentary>

</activity>

<activity><title>The Lead Coefficient</title>

<introduction><p>Our method for completing the square only works if the coefficient of <m>x^2</m> is 1. If the lead coefficient is not 1, we must divide each term of the equation by the lead coefficient.</p></introduction>

<task><p>Solve <m>~~4x^2-12x-1=0~~</m> by completing the square.</p>

            <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
            <p>Forgetting to divide by the coefficient of <m>x^2</m> is a common mistake.</p></commentary>

  <p>Divide each term by 4:</p>
  <p>Move the constant term to the right side:</p>
  <p>Complete the square on the left side:  
        <me>p=\frac{1}{2}(-3)=<fillin/>~~~~\text{and}~~~~~p^2=<fillin/></me></p>                                            
  <p>Add <m>p^2</m> to both sides:</p>
  <p>Write the left side as the square of a binomial, and simplify the right side:</p>
  <p>Extract roots to obtain two solutions: </p>
  <p>Use a calculator to find decimal approximations for each solution. Round to thousandths:</p>
