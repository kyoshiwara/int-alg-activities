  <title>Rational Exponents</title>

<introduction><title>Overview</title>
<p>In this Lesson we extend the study of rational exponents to powers of the form <m>a^{m/n}</m>. We simplify expressions using the laws of exponents, solve equations, and look at models that use power functions with rational exponents.</p>
    
<p>Begin class by reviewing the types of exponents we have already studied, and show how the defintion of rational exponents makes sense. You may want to practice using the laws of exponents, but do not make the examples unreasonably complicated, or the discussion may devolve into a lesson on adding fractions. It is also useful to solve a few equations that involve rational exponents.</p></introduction>

<introduction><p>Kepler's law gives a relation between the period <m>p</m> of a planet's revolution and its average distance <m>a</m> from the sun:
  <me>p^2=Ka^3</me>
where <m>K=1.243 \times 10^{-6}</m>, <m>p</m> is in millions of miles, and <m>a</m> is in years.</p></introduction>

<task><p>Solve Kepler's law for <m>a</m> in terms of <m>p</m>. Write your equation in two ways:  using a fractional exponent, and using a radical.</p>

            <aside><title>Note</title>
            <p>This task involves working with scientific notation. Show students how to simplify the formula for <m>a</m> with minimal calculator use.</p></aside></task>

<activity xml:id="act-6-3-2"><title>Vampire Bats</title>

 <introduction><p>Small animals like bats cannot survive for long without eating. The weight <m>W</m> of a typical vampire bat decreases over time until its next meal, according to the function   
    <me>W = f(h) = 130.25 \times 10^{-0.126}</me>
where <m>h</m> is the number of hours since the bat's most recent meal, and <m>W</m> is in grams.</p>

<task><p>Vampire bats sometimes donate blood (through regurgitation) to other bats that are close to starvation. Suppose a bat at point A on the curve donates 5 grams of blood to a bat at point D.
