    <p>This Activities Workbook provides a Lesson for each section in the book, consisting of Activities for students to complete in groups or with guidance from the instructor; or they can be used as support for a lecture format. The Lessons are designed to show students how the mathematical techniques they are learning can be applied to study and understand new situations. Each Lesson ends with a Wrap-Up and a set of "Check Your Understanding" questions for discussion.</p>

    <p>The Instructor's version of the Workbook contains an overview and teaching notes for each Lesson, including suggestions for using the Workbook and how to structure class time. There are also suggested questions for writing or discussion.</p>
