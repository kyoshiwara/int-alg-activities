<activity><title>Solving a System by Graphing</title>
  <introduction><p>Delbert and Francine are buying appliances for their new home. They have a choice of two different refrigerators: a standard model that sells for $1000 and an energy-efficient model at a price of $1200. The standard model costs $6 per month to run, and the energy-efficient model costs $2 per month.</p></introduction>

  <task><p>Write an equation for <m>S</m>, the total cost of purchasing and running the standard model for <m>t</m> months.</p></task>
  <task><p>Write an equation for <m>E</m>, the total cost of purchasing and running the energy-efficient model for <m>t</m> months.</p>

<activity><title>Using Technology</title>
<introduction><p>Francine wants to combine oats and wheat to make a cereal with 10 grams of protein per cup. Oat flakes provide 11 grams of protein per cup. Wheat flakes provide 8.5 grams of protein per cup. How many cups of each grain will she need for a box of cereal containing 3 cups?</p></introduction>

<task><p>Describe the two unknown quantities:</p>
    <p><m>\hphantom{00000} x:</m></p>
    <p><m>\hphantom{00000} y:</m></p></task>
<task><p>Complete the table.

<task><p>Write two equations, one about the amount of each grain in the mixture, and one about the amount of protein in the mixture.</p></task>
<task><p>Solve each equation for <m>y</m>, and graph them using technology. (Hint: What are the largest and smallest possible values for <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>? Use these values to choose a window.)</p></task>
<task><p>Use technology to find the intersection point. What do the coordinates of the intersection point tell us?</p></task>

  <task><p>Write each equation in slope-intercept form.  What do you notice?</p></task>
  <task><p>Without graphing its equations, how can you tell how many solutions a system has?</p></task>
<task><p>There are three possible forms for a system of two linear equations in two variables. List the names of these three forms, and how many solutions each form has.</p></task>
<task><p>Is it possible for a system of two linear equations in two variables to have exactly two solutions? Why or why not?</p></task>
