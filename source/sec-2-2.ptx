  <title>Linear Systems</title>

<commentary audience="instructor"><title>Overview</title>
<p>This Lesson reviews linear systems in two variables. We solve systems graphically â€” algebraic solutions are treated in the next Lesson. Part of the purpose of this Lesson is to practice the graphing techniques presented in Chapter 1, both on paper and using the graphing calculator.</p>

 <p> Students should learn to recognize inconsistent and dependent systems by writing both equations in the same form, either general linear or slope-intercept. For example, point out that two lines with the same slope but different -intercepts must be parallel.</p>
    
<p>The application to supply and demand may be new to students. It is also a good idea to review the formula  Profit = Revenue - Cost, and to remind students that profit can be positive or negative, and that breaking even means to make zero profit.</p>

<activity><title>Solving a System by Graphing</title>

<introduction><p>Delbert and Francine are buying appliances for their new home. They have a choice of two different refrigerators: a standard model that sells for $1000 and an energy-efficient model at a price of $1200. The standard model costs $6 per month to run, and the energy-efficient model costs $2 per month.</p></introduction>

<task><p>Write an equation for <m>S</m>, the total cost of purchasing and running the standard model for <m>t</m> months.</p></task>
  
<task><p>Write an equation for <m>E</m>, the total cost of purchasing and running the energy-efficient model for <m>t</m> months.</p></task>
    
<task><sidebyside widths="50% 40%"><stack><p>Complete the table of values and graph both equations on the grid.</p>

            <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
            <p>After practicing the intercept method of graphing, many students have forgotten that we can also graph a line by plotting points.</p></commentary>

            <p>Explain that the intersection point is the point at which <m>S=E</m>, so by setting the expressions for <m>S</m> and <m>E</m> equal and solving the equation, we are finding the value of <m>t</m> that makes <m>S</m> and <m>E</m> equal, that is, the month in which the total operating costs are equal.</p></commentary>

<activity><title>Using Technology</title>

<introduction><p>Francine wants to combine oats and wheat to make a cereal with 10 grams of protein per cup. Oat flakes provide 11 grams of protein per cup. Wheat flakes provide 8.5 grams of protein per cup. How many cups of each grain will she need for a box of cereal containing 3 cups?</p></introduction>

<task><p>Describe the two unknown quantities:</p>

<task><p>Write two equations, one about the amount of each grain in the mixture, and one about the amount of protein in the mixture.</p></task>

<task><p>Solve each equation for <m>y</m>, and graph them using technology. (Hint: What are the largest and smallest possible values for <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>? Use these values to choose a window.)</p>

           <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
           <p>Choosing a window is difficult for students. Suggest that they read the problem again, thinking about what <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> represent.</p></commentary></task>

<task><p>Use technology to find the intersection point. What do the coordinates of the intersection point tell us?</p></task>
