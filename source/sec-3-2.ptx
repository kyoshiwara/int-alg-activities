  <title>Intercepts, Solutions, and Factors</title>

<commentary audience="instructor"><title>Overview</title>
<p>Students find this Lesson quite difficult; in fact, you may need to spend two sessions on the lesson, one session on intercepts, factors and solutions, and one session on application problems.</p>
    
<p>Begin by pointing out that <m>ax^2+bx+c</m> is an expression, which we may be able to factor, <m>ax^2+bx+c=0</m> is an equation, which has solutions, and <m>y=ax^2+bx+c</m> is an equation in two variables, which we can graph.</p>  
    
<p>Some students will not remember how to factor quadratic expressions; if so you will probably have to review factoring outside of class time.  And although most students remember the zero-factor principle, they often do not apply it correctly. You will also need to spend some time discussing whether to use factoring or extraction of roots to solve a given equation. It is a good idea to keep quizzing students on their solving skills as we progress to each new solution technique.</p>   
    
<p>Although the Activities do not include finding a quadratic equation with given solutions, you should do some examples like Example 3.37 in class. Note that most students do not know what integers are.</p></commentary>

<task><sidebyside widths="45% 45%"><p>Graph the three equations below in the standard 
    window, and sketch the graphs on the grid at right. What do you notice about the <m>x</m>-intercepts?

    <p>Multiplying a quadratic expression by a constant does not change the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the graph.</p> </task>

            <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
            <p>The point of this task is to show that we can factor a constant from a quadratic equation without changing its solutions. If students are not convinced that we can "ignore" the constant, you might point out that the equations <m>x-2=0</m> and <m>5x-10=0</m> have the same solution.</p></commentary>

<task><p>Solve by factoring  <m>~~20x^2-40x-700 = 0</m>.</p></task>

            <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
            <p>Explain to the class that one of the main reasons they learn how to factor is to find the solutions of quadratic equations. On the other hand, if we know the solutions of the equation, we can write it in factored form.</p></commentary>

<task><p>Graph <m>~~y=0.1(x^2+9x-360)~~</m> on your calculator, using the ZInteger setting.</p></task>  

<task><p>Locate the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the graph.</p></task>  

<task><p>Use the <m>x</m>-intercepts to write the quadratic expression in factored form. (Do not try to factor the expression!)</p></task>

<subsection><title>A Quadratic Model</title>

            <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
            <p>The idea that rectangles with the same perimeter may have different areas is new to many students. Before tackling this model, you may want to illustrate the concept by drawing several rectangles with perimeter 36 but different dimensions and areas.</p></commentary>

<p>A rancher has 360 yards of fence to enclose a rectangular pasture. If she uses a riverbank to border one side of the pasture, she can enclose 16,000 square yards of land. What will the dimensions of the pasture be then?</p>  
<p>We'll solve this problem in three different ways. First, make a sketch of the pasture and the river.</p>

<activity><title>Method 1: Using a Table</title>

<introduction><p>Notice that you only have 360 yards of fence. So if you decide how wide the pasture is going to be, the length of the pasture is determined.</p></introduction>

            <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
            <p>Students find it difficult to compute the length of the rectangle when its width is known. Do several numerical examples.</p></commentary>

<task><p>Use the perimeter of the pasture, 360 yards, to write a formula for the length of the pasture in terms of its width. (Be careful: remember that one side of the pasture does not need any fence!)</p>  
  <p>Length = </p></task>

<task><p>Make a table that shows the areas of pastures of various widths.</p>
      <tabular top="minor" halign="center" right="minor" left="minor" bottom="minor">              
                <row bottom="minor">
                    <cell>Width</cell>
                    <cell>Length</cell>

                <row><cell>10</cell>
                    <cell>340</cell>

                    <cell><m>\hphantom{000000}</m></cell>
                    <cell><m>\hphantom{000000}</m></cell></row>
                <row><cell><m>\hphantom{000000}</m></cell>
                    <cell><m>\hphantom{000000}</m></cell>

                    <cell><m>\hphantom{000000}</m></cell></row>
    </tabular></task>

<task><p>Continue the table until you find the pasture whose area is 16,000 square yards.</p>

<activity><title>Method 2: Using a Graph</title>

<introduction><p>On your sketch of the pasture in part (1), label the width of the pasture as <m>x</m>.</p></introduction>

<task><p>Write an expression for the length of the pasture if its width is <m>x</m>. (Hint: How did you compute the length of the pasture in Method 1?</p>
    <p> Length = </p></task>

<task><p>Write an expression for the area <m>A</m> of the pasture if its width is <m>x</m>.</p> 
    <p>Area = </p></task>                                                

<task><sidebyside widths="45% 50%"><p>Use technology to graph the equation for <m>A</m>. If you use a calculator, set the window at
      <md><mrow>\text{Xmin} = 0,~~~\amp \text{Xmax} = 188</mrow>
          <mrow>\text{Ymin} =0,~~~\amp \text{Ymax} = 17,000</mrow></md>
Then copy the graph onto the grid.</p> 
        <image source="act-3-2-2.png"></image></sidebyside></task>

            <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
            <p>Emphasize the fact that the graph shows how the area changes as we change the width of the rectangle; the length of the rectangle does not appear in this graph.</p></commentary>

<task><p>On the graph, find the pasture of area 16,000 square yards. Label the correct point on your graph.</p>
      <p>Dimensions of pasture:</p></task>

<activity><title>Method 3: Using an Equation</title>

<task><p>Refer to steps (a) and (b) of Method 2, and write an equation for the area <m>A</m> of the pasture in terms of its width <m>x</m>.</p>
    <p>Area = </p></task>

<task><p>Substitute <m>A = 16,000</m> and solve your equation algebraically.</p>
