  <activity><title>A Quadratic Model:  Free-Fall</title>
  <introduction><p>A skydiver jumps out of an airplane at 11,000 feet.  While she is in free-fall, her altitude in feet <m>t</m> seconds after jumping is given by
      <me>h=-16t^2-16t+11,000</me></p></introduction>
  <task><p>Use technology to complete the table of values. (You can use the Table feature of your calculator.)</p>

<activity><title>Area and Perimeter</title>
<introduction><sidebyside widths="55% 40%"><p>A dog trainer has 100 meters of chain link fence.  She wants to enclose a total area of 250 square meters in three pens of equal size, as shown at right. We will find the length and width of each pen.</p>
<image source="act-4-1-2.png"></image></sidebyside></introduction>

<task><p>Let <m>l</m> and <m>w</m> represent the length and width of each pen. Label the figure.  (How many <m>l</m>'s and <m>w</m>'s do you have?)</p></task>
<task><p>Write an equation in <m>l</m> and <m>w</m> about the amount of chain link fence. (Hint: Is this an area or a perimeter?)</p></task>
<task><p>Solve your equation for <m>l</m> in terms of <m>w</m>.</p></task>
<task><p>Write an equation in terms of <m>l</m> and <m>w</m> for the total area enclosed.</p></task>  
<task><p>Substitute your expression for <m>l</m> from part (c) into your equation from part (d).</p></task>
<task><p>Solve your equation from part (d). (There are two solutions!)</p></task>
<task><p>Find the dimensions of each pen.  Round your answers to hundredths. ("Dimensions" means length and width. There are two different solutions to the problem.)</p></task>

<subsection><title>Check Your Understanding</title>
<p><ol>
<li><p>In Activity 1c, what value did you substitute for <m>c</m>?  Why?  When is <m>h=11,000</m>?</p></li>
<li><p>In Activity 2, did you solve an equation about area or about perimeter to find the values of <m>w</m>?  How did you use the other quantity in your solution?</p></li>
<li><p>In Activity 2f, you found two solutions to the equation.  Are these values the dimensions of each pen?</p></li>
<li><p>In Activity 4, what was different about the procedure in part (a) from the procedure in part (b)?</p></li>
