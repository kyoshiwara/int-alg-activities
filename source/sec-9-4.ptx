  <title>Conic Sections: Hyperbolas</title>

<commentary audience="instructor"><title>Overview</title>
<p>In this lesson we consider hyperbolas and categorize the conic sections. You might want to start class with a calculator demonstration:  solve <m>x^2 + y^2 = 1</m>  for <m>y</m> and graph in a squre window, then do the same for <m>y^2 - x^2 = 1</m> and <m>x^2 - y^2 = 1</m>.  If your class is strong enough, you can come back to these equations and graphs when you discuss the asymptotes of a hyperbola.</p>
    
<p>You might also point out to the class that we are not exploring the geometric properties of parabolas in this course, but that by interchanging <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in the standard equation, we obtain parabolas that open left or right.</p></commentary>

<activity><title>Central Hyperbolas</title>

<task><p>Write the two standard equations for central hyperbolas.</p>
<p><ol>
  <li><p>(opens left and right)</p>
      <p></p></li>
  <li><p>(opens up and down)</p>
      <p></p></li>
  </ol></p>
<p>The segment joining the two vertices is called the <fillin/>.</p>
<p>The perpendicular segment is called the <fillin/>.</p></task>

<task><p>Follow the steps to graph the hyperbola  <m>~\dfrac{x^2}{9} - \dfrac{y^2}{16} = 1</m></p>.
  <sidebyside widths="50% 40%"><stack><p>Complete the table and plot the vertices.</p>
      <tabular top="minor" halign="center" right="minor" left="minor" bottom="minor">              
                <row bottom="minor">
                    <cell><m>x</m></cell>
                    <cell><m>y</m></cell></row>
                <row><cell><m>0</m></cell>
                    <cell><m>\hphantom{00000}</m></cell></row>
                <row><cell><m>\hphantom{00000}</m></cell>

<p>Plot the two points <m>(0,b)</m> and <m>(0,-b)</m>. These points are not on the hyperbola -- we will use them, along with the vertices, to sketch the central rectangle.</p>  

<p>Sketch the asymptotes through the diagonals of the central rectangle.</p>

<p>Finally, sketch the two branches of the hyperbola through the vertices and approaching the asymptotes. (Neither the central rectangle nor the asymptotes are part of the graph; they are just tools.)</p></task>

            <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
            <p>After students have graphed ellipses, they do not find hyperbolas any harder. Do point out that the branches of a hyperbola are not parabolas, but instead become closer to linear as they approach their asymptotes.</p></commentary>

<task><p>Follow the steps to graph  <m>~~-4x^2 + 25y^2 = 100</m></p>
  <p>Write the equation in standard form:  divide both sides by 100.</p>
  <p>Identify the values of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.</p>
<p>Plot the vertices <m>(0,b)</m> and <m>(0,-b)</m>, and the two points <m>(a,0)</m> and <m>(-a,0)</m>.</p>
    <image source="act-9-4-1.png" width="40%"></image>
<p>Sketch the central rectangle.</p>
<p>Sketch the asymptotes.</p>
<p>Sketch the hyperbola.</p></task>

<activity><title>Translated Hyperbolas</title>

<task><p>The standard forms for a hyperbolas centered at <m>(h,k)</m> are</p>
<p><ol>
  <li><p></p>
      <p></p></li>
  <li><p></p>
      <p></p></li>
  </ol></p></task>

<task><p>Follow the steps to graph  <m>~~\dfrac{(x-3)^2}{4} - \dfrac{(y+1)^2}{9} = 1</m>.</p>
<p>Identify the values of the center <m>(h,k)</m> and <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.</p>
      <p><m>~~~~~~(h,k) = </m></p>
      <p><m>~~~~~~a=</m></p>
      <p><m>~~~~~~b=</m></p>                                               
<p>Plot the vertices and the ends of the conjugate axis.</p>
    <image source="act-9-4-1.png" width="40%"></image>
<p>Sketch the central rectangle.</p>
<p>Sketch the asymptotes.</p>
<p>Sketch the hyperbola.</p></task>

<task><p>Find the equations of the asymptotes. The asymptotes pass through the center of the hyperbola, so</p>
      <p><m>~~(x_1, y_1) = (h,k) = </m></p>
  <p>Look at the central rectangle to see that the slopes of the asymptotes are</p>
      <p><m>~~m = \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \dfrac{\pm b}{a} = </m></p>
  <p>Substitute these values into the point-slope form and find the equations of the asymptotes.</p></task>

            <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
            <p>Finding the equations of the asymptotes is a good review of using point-slope formula.</p></commentary>

<task><p>On the same grid above, sketch the graph of <m>~~\dfrac{(y+1)^2}{9} - \dfrac{(x-3)^2}{4} = 1</m>.</p>  
  <p>How does the graph differ from the first graph?</p>
  <p>Finally, on the same grid sketch the graph of <m>~~\dfrac{(x-3)^2}{4} + \dfrac{(y+1)^2}{9} = 1</m>.</p>
  <p>Very nice.</p></task>

            <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
            <p>Try to use different colored pens for the graph; many students find this exercise aesthetically pleasing.</p></commentary>

<activity><title>Standard Form</title>

<task><p>Follow the steps to write the equation  
    <me>4x^2-6y^2+16x-12y-14=0</me>
  in standard form.</p> 
<p>Collect the <m>x</m>-terms and <m>y</m>-terms together.
    <me><fillin characters="16"/> = 14</me></p>                                               
<p>Factor out the coefficients of <m>x^2</m> and <m>y^2</m>. Be careful:  you are factoring a 
    negative number from the <m>y^2</m>-terms.                
    <me><fillin characters="16"/> = 14</me></p>
<p>Complete the square in <m>x</m> and in <m>y</m>. Be careful! Notice that you have really added <m>4(4) = 16</m> to 
the <m>x</m>-terms and <m>-6(1) = -6</m> to the <m>y</m>-terms on the left side of the equation.</p> 
<p> Simplify each side.</p>
<p>Divide both sides by the constant, and simplify.</p></task>
