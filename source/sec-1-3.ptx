  <title>Intercepts</title>

<commentary audience="instructor"><title>Overview</title>
<p>In this Lesson we find the intercepts of a linear model, and interpret their meaning in the context of the model. Some students will have forgotten how to find the intercepts, and most will need help interpreting the meaning of the intercepts in context.  A common mistake is to give the meaning of the variable on the appropriate axis, instead of its value at the intercept.</p>
<p>We also review the intercept method for graphing a line.  Finally, we consider linear models given in the general linear form, <m>Ax+By=C</m>.</p></commentary>

<activity><title>Interpreting the Intercepts</title>
    <p>Copper is the third most widely used metal, behind iron and aluminum. In 2007 the US Geological Survey estimated that there are 490 million tons of usable copper reserves left in the world. The global consumption of copper in 2007 was 17.8 million tons.</p>

    <task><p>Supposing that we continue to consume copper at the same annual rate, write an equation for the amount of copper, <m>C</m>, in millions of tons, remaining <m>t</m> years after 2007.</p></task>

    <task><p>Complete the table of values.</p>

            <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
            <p> You may have to remind students that  is measured from 2007, not from the previous table entry; so that for instance in 2015, <m>t=8</m> (not 5).</p></commentary>

  <activity><title>General Form for a Linear Equation</title>
    <p>The owner of a gas station has $19,200 to spend on unleaded gas this month. Regular unleaded costs him $2.40 per gallon, and premium unleaded costs $3.20 per gallon.</p>
    <task><p>Write algebraic expressions to answer the questions:</p>

            <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
            <p>Many students will immediately write an equation (the answer to part (b)), but will have trouble answering the two questions in part (a).</p></commentary>

          <p>How much do <m>x</m> gallons of regular cost?</p>  
          <p>How much do <m>y</m> gallons of premium cost?</p></task>

    <task><p>Write an equation that relates the amount of regular unleaded gasoline, <m>x</m>,the owner can buy and the amount of premium unleaded, <m>y</m>.</p></task>

    <task><p>Find the intercepts and use the intercept method to sketch the graph.</p>
