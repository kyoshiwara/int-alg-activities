<activity><title>Interpreting the Intercepts</title>
    <p>Copper is the third most widely used metal, behind iron and aluminum. In 2007 the US Geological Survey estimated that there are 490 million tons of usable copper reserves left in the world. The global consumption of copper in 2007 was 17.8 million tons.</p>
    <task><p>Supposing that we continue to consume copper at the same annual rate, write an equation for the amount of copper, <m>C</m>, in millions of tons, remaining <m>t</m> years after 2007.</p></task>
    <task><p>Complete the table of values.</p>

    <p>The owner of a gas station has $19,200 to spend on unleaded gas this month. Regular unleaded costs him $2.40 per gallon, and premium unleaded costs $3.20 per gallon.</p>
    <task><p>Write algebraic expressions to answer the questions:</p>
          <p>How much do <m>x</m> gallons of regular cost?</p>  
          <p>How much do <m>y</m> gallons of premium cost?</p></task>
    <task><p>Write an equation that relates the amount of regular unleaded gasoline, <m>x</m>,the owner can buy and the amount of premium unleaded, <m>y</m>.</p></task>
    <task><p>Find the intercepts and use the intercept method to sketch the graph.</p>
