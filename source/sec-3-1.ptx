<activity><title>Volume</title>
<introduction><p>You are designing a new coffee maker. The coffee filter must be 8.4 centimeters tall and shaped like a cone. The volume of the filter will therefore depend on how wide the opening is (the radius of the cone).</p></introduction>

<task><p>Write a formula for the filter's volume <m>V</m> in terms of its widest radius <m>r</m> (at the top of the filter). (Hint: Look up the formula for the volume of a cone.)</p>
<p>Simplify your formula by multiplying the constants together.</p></task>

<task><p>Complete the table of values. Round the volumes to one decimal place.</p>

  <task><p>Look at the table of values. If you double the radius of the filter, by what factor does the volume increase?</p></task>
  <task><p>Write and solve an equation to answer the question: If the volume of the filter is 302.4 cubic centimeters, what is its radius?</p></task>
  <task><p>Use technology to graph the volume equation. (Use the table of values to help you choose a window.) Sketch your graph on paper, including scales on the axes). Label the coordinates of the point on the graph that corresponds to the filter in part (d).</p></task>

<activity><title>Compound Interest</title>
<introduction><p>Cyril would like to invest $5000 for two years in a money market account that pays interest compounded annually.</p>
</introduction>

<task><p>Write a formula for the balance, <m>B</m>, of Cyril's account after two years in terms of the interest rate, <m>r</m>.</p></task>

<task><p>Complete the table showing Cyril's account balance after two years for various interest rates.</p>
