  <title>Extraction of Roots</title>

<commentary audience="instructor"><title>Overview</title>
<p>This is the first Lesson on quadratic equations. Take a few moments to explain how to recognize a quadratic equation, and to obtain the graph of the basic parabola. It is also useful to review solving an equation by graphing (in particular a quadratic equation), and to stress the difference between an exact solution and a decimal approximation. Point out that our first quadratic models include the Pythagorean theorem, formulas for volume an d surface area, and the compound interest formula.</p>

<p>We recommend going over these Activities with the class, using a smart board or a projector. Almost all of the skills required will be new to most students. Even students who recently completed elementary algebra have trouble with extraction of roots: although solving <m>x^2=16</m> is easy for them, solving <m>(x+3)^2=16</m> is not. In particular, watch out for the mistake of solving <m>A=P(1+r)^2</m> by subtracting <m>P</m> from both sides.</p></commentary>
  
<activity><title>Volume</title>

<introduction><p>You are designing a new coffee maker. The coffee filter must be 8.4 centimeters tall and shaped like a cone. The volume of the filter will therefore depend on how wide the opening is (the radius of the cone).</p></introduction>

<task><p>Write a formula for the filter's volume <m>V</m> in terms of its widest radius <m>r</m> (at the top of the filter). (Hint: Look up the formula for the volume of a cone.)</p>
<p>Simplify your formula by multiplying the constants together.</p></task>

<task><p>Complete the table of values. Round the volumes to one decimal place.</p>

  <task><p>Look at the table of values. If you double the radius of the filter, by what factor does the volume increase?</p></task>
  
  <task><p>Write and solve an equation to answer the question: If the volume of the filter is 302.4 cubic centimeters, what is its radius?</p></task>
  
  <task><p>Use technology to graph the volume equation. (Use the table of values to help you choose a window.) Sketch your graph on paper, including scales on the axes). Label the coordinates of the point on the graph that corresponds to the filter in part (d).</p></task>
