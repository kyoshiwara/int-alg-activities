<activity><title>Doubling-Time</title>  
<task><p>Lately the inflation rate in Freedonia has been 8% annually. ("Inflation" means that prices are rising by 8% per year.) Write a formula for the price <m>P</m> of a $5 item as a function of time, <m>t</m>.</p></task>  
<task><p>How long will it take for the price to double from $5 to $10? (Round to the nearest year.)</p></task>
<task><p>Use technology to graph your function in the window for  <m>0 \le x \le 100</m>, and sketch the curve on the grid.</p>

<task><p>Use your graph to complete the table below. How long will it take the price to double from $10 to $20? From $20 to $40? (Round to the nearest year.)</p>

<task><p>Add the horizontal lines <m>~y=10,~y=20~</m> and <m>~y=40~</m> to your graph. Use the intersect feature to verify that the price doubled from $5 to $10, from $10 to $20, and from $20 to $40 in equal periods of time.</p></task>   
<task><p>Use algebra to answer the question:  What is the doubling time, rounded to four decimal places?</p></task>

<activity><title>Compound Interest</title>
<introduction><p>If <m>P</m> dollars is invested at an annual interest rate <m>r</m> (expressed as a decimal) compounded <m>n</m> times yearly, the balance of the account <m>A</m> after <m>t</m> years is given by  
      <me>A = P \left( 1 + \dfrac{r}{n} \right)^{nt}</me></p></introduction>

<task><p>If you invest $1000 at 10% compounded quarterly, how long will it take the balance to double?</p></task>

<activity><title>Half-Life</title>  
<introduction><p> The half-life of a radioactive substance is the time it takes for half of the substance to decay.</p></introduction>

<task><p>Suppose we have 200 grams of a radioactive substance whose half-life is 6 years. Complete the table and sketch a graph.</p>
