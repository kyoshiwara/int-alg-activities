  <title>Applications of Exponential Functions</title>

<commentary audience="instructor"><title>Overview</title>
<p>In this Lesson we consider doubling time and half-life. Try to get students to understand this fundamental difference between linear and exponential functions: while linear functions increase or decrease by equal amounts over equal time intervals, exponential functions increase or decrease by equal factors over equal time intervals. If possible, it is also desirable for students to understand that there is nothing special about the factor 2; it is merely convenient.</p>
    
<p>At this point in their study of exponential functions, students begin to confuse the various parameters. Take a few minutes to review some basic definitions: <m>P(t)</m>  is a variable, but <m>P_0</m> is a constant; <m>r</m> is the percent growth rate and <m>b=1+r</m> is the growth factor; and so on.</p></commentary>

<activity><title>Doubling-Time</title>  

<task><p>Lately the inflation rate in Freedonia has been 8% annually. ("Inflation" means that prices are rising by 8% per year.) Write a formula for the price <m>P</m> of a $5 item as a function of time, <m>t</m>.</p></task>  

<task><p>How long will it take for the price to double from $5 to $10? (Round to the nearest year.)</p></task>

            <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
            <p>Round the the doubling time to 9 years to simplify the sketch in part (d).</p></commentary>

<task><p>Use technology to graph your function in the window for  <m>0 \le x \le 100</m>, and sketch the curve on the grid.</p>

<task><p>Use your graph to complete the table below. How long will it take the price to double from $10 to $20? From $20 to $40? (Round to the nearest year.)</p>

    </tabular></task>

<task><p>Add the horizontal lines <m>~y=10,~y=20~</m> and <m>~y=40~</m> to your graph. Use the intersect feature to verify that the price doubled from $5 to $10, from $10 to $20, and from $20 to $40 in equal periods of time.</p></task>   

<task><p>Use algebra to answer the question:  What is the doubling time, rounded to four decimal places?</p></task>

<activity><title>Compound Interest</title>

<introduction><p>If <m>P</m> dollars is invested at an annual interest rate <m>r</m> (expressed as a decimal) compounded <m>n</m> times yearly, the balance of the account <m>A</m> after <m>t</m> years is given by  
      <me>A = P \left( 1 + \dfrac{r}{n} \right)^{nt}</me></p></introduction>

<task><p>If you invest $1000 at 10% compounded quarterly, how long will it take the balance to double?</p></task>

                <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
                <p>You may need to explain that "quarterly" means four time per year.</p></commentary>

<activity><title>Half-Life</title>  

<introduction><p> The half-life of a radioactive substance is the time it takes for half of the substance to decay.</p></introduction>

<task><p>Suppose we have 200 grams of a radioactive substance whose half-life is 6 years. Complete the table and sketch a graph.</p>

            <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
            <p>Use the graph to emphasize that the substance is not completely gone after two half-lives!</p></commentary>

<task><p>Write and solve an equation to find the annual decay factor for the substance in part (a). Then write its decay law.</p></task>

<task><p>What is the annual percent decay rate?</p></task>

            <commentary audience="instructor"><title>Note</title>
            <p>Students usually need to see several examples before they can convert easily between decay rate and half-life, or between growth rate and doubling time.</p></commentary>

<activity><title>Radium</title>

<task><p>Radium-226 decays at a rate of 0.4% per year.  Write a formula for <m>Q(t)</m>, the amount of radium-226 left after <m>t</m> years, in terms of <m>Q_0</m>.</p></task>

<task><p>Find the half-life, <m>H</m>, of radium-226. (Hint:  You do not need to know the value of <m>Q_0</m>.)</p></task>

<task><p>Use your answer to part (a) and the formula for <m>Q(t)</m> in terms of <m>H</m> to write another formula for <m>Q(t)</m>.</p></task>
