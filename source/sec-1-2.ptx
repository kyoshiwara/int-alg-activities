  <title>Graphs and Equations</title>

<introduction><title>Overview</title>
<p>This Lesson emphasizes the relationship between a graph and an equation or inequality. This is a difficult concept for students, and it is worth pointing out to the class that understanding this connection is the goal of the Lesson. Stress that they must show their work on the graph. They will want to solve all the problems algebraically, but you could mention that they will soon encounter equations that they cannot solve with algebra.</p>
<p>Solving linear inequalities graphically helps students see that all the solutions lie on one side of the boundary value. While they work on the Activities, walk around to check each student's graphs, to see if they are getting it. If one person in the group is marking the graphs correctly, ask him or her to demonstrate the graphical technique to the others in the group.</p>

        <li><p>The point <m>(-1,7)</m> lies on the graph of <m>y=4-3x</m>.</p></li>

<subsection><title>Wrap-Up</title>

<p>In this Lesson, we worked on the following skills related to linear models:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li><p>Recognize a solution of an equation or an inequality</p></li>
    <li><p>Solve a linear inequality, and graph the solutions on a number line</p></li>
    <li><p>Recognize a solution of an equation in two variables</p></li>
    <li><p>Use the connection between the graph of an equation and its solutions</p></li>
    <li><p>Use a graph to solve an equation or inequality in one variable</p></li>
</ul></p></subsection>

<subsection><title>Questions for Writing or Discussion</title>
<p><ol>
<li><p>In <xref ref="act-1-2-2" text="custom">Activity 2</xref> we used a graph of <m>y=4-3x</m> to solve the equation <m>4-3x=10</m>. Why can we do this? (How are the two equations related?)</p></li>
<li><p>In <xref ref="act-1-2-3" text="custom">Activity 3a</xref> we shaded one side of the boundary value, <m>x=3</m>, on the <m>x</m>-axis, and said that the solutions of the inequality are any <m>x</m>-values with <m>x \lt 3</m>. Verify the solution by checking two <m>x</m>-values less than 3, and two <m>x</m>-values greater than 3.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose you have an increasing graph, for example, <m>y=2x-8</m>. If you know that <m>y \gt 5</m> for a particular <m>x</m>-value, say, <m>x=9</m>, how do you know that <m>y \gt 5</m> for all <m>x \gt 9</m>?</p></li>
<li><p>In <xref ref="act-1-2-2" text="custom">Activity 2</xref> we solved the equation <m>4-3x=10</m> by using the graph of <m>y=4-3x</m>.  Explain why the following statement is incorrect: "The solution of <m>4-3x=10</m> is <m>(-2,10)</m>."</p></li>
