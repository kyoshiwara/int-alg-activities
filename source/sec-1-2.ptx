  <title>Graphs and Equations</title>

<commentary audience="instructor"><title>Overview</title>
<p>This Lesson emphasizes the relationship between a graph and an equation or inequality. This is a difficult concept for students, and it is worth pointing out to the class that understanding this connection is the goal of the Lesson. Stress that they must show their work on the graph. They will want to solve all the problems algebraically, but you could mention that they will soon encounter equations that they cannot solve with algebra.</p>
<p>Try to make students understand that, for a linear inequality, all the solutions lie on one side of the boundary value. This is why using a single test value works. The technique will have to be modified slightly when we solve nonlinear inequalities.
While they work on the Activities, walk around to check each student's graphs, to see if they are getting it. If one person in the group is marking the graphs correctly, ask him or her to demonstrate the graphical technique to the others in the group.</p>

    <p>Look back at your work in Activity 2. Use the graph to show that the following three statements are different ways of saying the same thing: <ol>
        <li><p>The point <m>(-1,7)</m> lies on the graph of <m>y=4-3x</m>.</p></li>                     
        <li><p> <m>x=-1,~y=7</m>  is a solution of the equation <m>y=4-3x</m>.</p></li>      
        <li><p> <m>x=-1</m> is a solution of the equation <m>7=4-3x</m>.</p></li>

        <p> Point out that <m>2x+1 \lt 7</m> is the same as <m>y \lt 7</m>, so we are looking for <m>x</m>-values that produce points on the graph with <m>y</m>-coordinate less than 7.</p></commentary>

<commentary audience="instructor"><title>Questions for Writing or Discussion</title>
<p><ol>
<li><p>In Activity 2 we used a graph of <m>y=4-3x</m> to solve the equation <m>4-3x=10</m>. Why can we do this? (How are the two equations related?)</p></li>
<li><p>In Activity 3a we shaded one side of the boundary value, <m>x=3</m>, on the <m>x</m>-axis, and said that the solutions of the inequality are any <m>x</m>-values with <m>x \lt 3</m>. Verify the solution by checking two <m>x</m>-values less than 3, and two <m>x</m>-values greater than 3.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose you have an increasing graph, for example, <m>y=2x-8</m>. If you know that <m>y \gt 5</m> for a particular <m>x</m>-value, say, <m>x=9</m>, how do you know that <m>y \gt 5</m> for all <m>x \gt 9</m>?</p></li>
<li><p>In Activity 2 we solved the equation <m>4-3x=10</m> by using the graph of <m>y=4-3x</m>.  Explain why the following statement is incorrect: "The solution of <m>4-3x=10</m> is <m>(-2,10)</m>."</p></li>
