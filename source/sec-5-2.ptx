<activity><title>The Graph of a Function</title>
<introduction><p>The graph shows the U.S. unemployment rate as a function of time, <m>U=f(t)</m>, for the years 1985-2004.</p>
    <image source="act-5-2-1.png" width="70%"></image></introduction>

<task><p>Evaluate <m>f(1993)</m>, and explain its meaning for this problem.</p></task>
<task><p>When did the unemployment rate reach its highest value, and what was its highest value?  Write your answer with function notation.</p></task>
<task><p>When did the unemployment rate fall to its lowest value, and what was its lowest value?  Write your answer with function notation.</p></task>
<task><p>Solve the equation <m>f(t)=4.5</m>, and explain its meaning for this problem.</p></task>
<task><p>Over what intervals was the unemployment rate increasing?</p></task>

<activity><title>Functions Defined by Graphs</title>
<introduction><p>The figure shows the graph of the function <m>y=F(s)</m>. A solid dot means that the point is part of the graph, and an open circle means that the point is not part of the graph.</p>

<task><p>Find <m>F(-3), F(-2)</m> and <m>F(2)</m>.</p></task>

<task><p>For what value(s) of <m>s</m> is <m>F(s)=-1</m> ?</p></task>

<task><p>Find the maximum value of <m>F(s)</m>. For what value(s) of <m>s</m> does <m>F</m> take on its maximum value?</p></task>

<task><p>Find the minimum value of <m>F(s)</m>  For what value(s) of <m>s</m> does <m>F</m> take on its minimum value?</p></task>
</activity>

<activity><title>Solving Equations and Inequalities</title>
<introduction><p>Each figure shows a graph of 
  <me>B = f(p)= \dfrac{1}{3}p^3 - 3p + 2</me>     
Use the graph to solve the following equations and inequalities. Show your work on the graph. Write your answers in interval notation.</p>

<subsection><title>Check Your Understanding</title>
<p><ol>
<li><p>In Activity 1, what is the input variable, and what is the output variable?</p></li>     
<li><p>In Activity 1d, how did you solve the equation?</p></li>
<li><p>Is it possible for a function to have more than one maximum value? Is it possible for a function to take on its maximum value at more than one point?</p></li>
<li><p>In Activity 3, how do you know that the graph represents a function?</p></li>
</ol></p></subsection>

<subsection><title>Wrap-Up</title>
<p>In this Lesson, we worked on the following skills and goals related to functions:</p>
<p><ul>
<li><p>Use function notation to label points on a graph</p></li>
<li><p>Interpret the coordinates of a point on the graph of a function</p></li> 
<li><p>Use the vertical line test</p></li>
<li><p>Solve an equation or inequality graphically</p></li>
</ul></p></subsection>
