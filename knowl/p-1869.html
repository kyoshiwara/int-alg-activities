<p>In this lesson we introduce the properties of logarithms and use them to solve exponential equations. Instead of trying to "prove" the properties, it may be more effective to illustrate them with numerical values, as is done in the reading.  Remind students that "<span class="process-math">\(\log (x)\)</span>" is function notation: the parentheses do not indicate multiplication, and are thus not subject to the distributive law. When solving equations, you will also need to empahsize that <span class="process-math">\(\dfrac{\log a}{\log b} \not= \dfrac{\log a}{\log b}\text{.}\)</span> Students at this level have a hard time applying a general rule expressed algebraically to specific instances, so it is a good idea to work through several examples.</p>
