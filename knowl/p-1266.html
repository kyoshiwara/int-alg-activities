<p>In the middle ages in Europe, castles were used as defensive strongholds. An attacking force would build a huge catapult called a trebuchet to hurl rocks and scrap metal inside the castle walls. The engineers could adjust its range by varying the mass (or weight) of the missiles. The mass, <span class="process-math">\(m\text{,}\)</span> of the projectile is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, <span class="process-math">\(d\text{,}\)</span> to the target.</p>
