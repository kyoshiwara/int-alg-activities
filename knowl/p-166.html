<p>This Lesson reviews the notion of slope, which students learned in elementary algebra, but emphasizes the meaning of the slope as a rate of change. Notice that in this Lesson we do not use the coordinate formula for slope, <span class="process-math">\(y=\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\text{;}\)</span>  that formula is taken up in Lesson 1.5. All of the slopes in this Lesson can be computed from the definition, <span class="process-math">\(m=\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\text{.}\)</span> Encourage students to include units in their calculation of <span class="process-math">\(\Delta y\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\Delta x\)</span> to help them interpret the slope as a rate.</p>
