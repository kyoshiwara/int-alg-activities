<p>This Lesson emphasizes the relationship between a graph and an equation or inequality. This is a difficult concept for students, and it is worth pointing out to the class that understanding this connection is the goal of the Lesson. Stress that they must show their work on the graph. They will want to solve all the problems algebraically, but you could mention that they will soon encounter equations that they cannot solve with algebra.</p>
