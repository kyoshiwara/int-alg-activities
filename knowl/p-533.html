<p>Some students will not remember how to factor quadratic expressions; if so you will probably have to review factoring outside of class time.  And although most students remember the zero-factor principle, they often do not apply it correctly. You will also need to spend some time discussing whether to use factoring or extraction of roots to solve a given equation. It is a good idea to keep quizzing students on their solving skills as we progress to each new solution technique.</p>
