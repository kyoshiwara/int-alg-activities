<p>This is the first Lesson on quadratic equations. Take a few moments to explain how to recognize a quadratic equation, and to obtain the graph of the basic parabola. It is also useful to review solving an equation by graphing (in particular a quadratic equation), and to stress the difference between an exact solution and a decimal approximation. Point out that our first quadratic models include the Pythagorean theorem, formulas for volume an d surface area, and the compound interest formula.</p>
