<p>Students may have been taught to find a linear equation by substituting a point into the slope-intercept formula to find <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> but at this stage it is important that they master the point-slope formula. Finding a linear equation to fit two points is one of the most useful skills they will learn in this course. Note that we give two alternate forms for the formula:  the fractional form, <span class="process-math">\(\dfrac{y-y_1}{x-x_1} = m\text{,}\)</span> is easier for students if the slope is a common fraction. The form <span class="process-math">\(y=y_1+m(x-x_1)\)</span>  captures the mechanics of the formula, and will occur in calculus.</p>
