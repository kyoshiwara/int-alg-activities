<p>This is a skills lesson on completing the square. You may want to begin by presenting a quadratic equation that cannot be solved by factoring. Explain that our goal is to turn any quadratic expression into a square of a binomial, so that we can then solve the equation by extraction of roots. It is also helpful to tell students that although the quadratic formula is usually faster than completing the square, we'll need this skill for other applications (conic sections) later on.</p>
