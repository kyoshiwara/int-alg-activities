<p>The Global Positioning System (GPS) uses a collection of satellites in orbit around the earth. Each GPS satellite transmits its position and the current time at regular intervals. A person with a GPS receiver can calculate his or her distance from the satellite by comparing the time of transmission with the time when it receives the signal. Of course, there are many points at the same distance from the satelliteâ€”in fact, the set of all points at a fixed distance from the satellite lie on a sphere centered at the satellite. That is why there are several satellites: You calculate your position by finding the intersection point of several such spheres centered on different satellites.</p>
