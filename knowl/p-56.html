<p>Try to make students understand that, for a linear inequality, all the solutions lie on one side of the boundary value. This is why using a single test value works. The technique will have to be modified slightly when we solve nonlinear inequalities. While they work on the Activities, walk around to check each student's graphs, to see if they are getting it. If one person in the group is marking the graphs correctly, ask him or her to demonstrate the graphical technique to the others in the group.</p>
