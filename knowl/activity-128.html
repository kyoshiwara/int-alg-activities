<div class="introduction"><p>The owner of a print shop volunteers to produce flyers for his candidate's campaign. His large printing press can complete the job in 4 hours, and the smaller model can finish the flyers in 6 hours. How long will it take to print the flyers if he runs both presses simultaneously?</p></div>
<article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h4>
<p>Part (1):  Write fractions of the job can each press can complete in 1 hour.</p>

<p>Small press:</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h4>
<p>What fraction of the job can be completed in 1 hour with both presses running simultaneously?</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h4>

<p>Part (2): Now we'll try the same problem with variables. Suppose that the large press can complete a job in <span class="process-math">\(t_1\)</span> hours and the smaller press takes <span class="process-math">\(t_1\)</span> hours.  (Use your answers above as a guide.)</p>
<p>Write expressions for the fraction of a job that each press can complete in 1 hour.(Use your answers to Part (1) as a guide.)</p>

<p>Write a complex fraction for the time needed to complete the job with both presses running.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(g)</span></h4>
<p>Write your complex fraction as a simple fraction.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(h)</span></h4>
