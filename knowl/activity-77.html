<div class="introduction">
<p>Here are some situations that can be modeled by variations of the basic functions.  Match each situation with a function from the list below, and with the appropriate graph.  Write your function with the variables in the description, and answer any questions about the model.</p>

<p>The time, <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> it takes to travel a certain distance, <span class="process-math">\(d\text{,}\)</span> is inversely proportional to the speed, <span class="process-math">\(r\text{,}\)</span> at which you travel. For example, to travel 400 miles at an average speed of 50 miles per hour will take 8 hours.</p>
<p>Write a formula for <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> as a function of <span class="process-math">\(r\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Choose the appropriate graph, and label the axes.</p>
<p>If you double your average speed, what happens to the travel time?</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h4>
<p>The distance,<span class="process-math">\(D\text{,}\)</span> needed to stop a car is proportional to the square of its velocity, <span class="process-math">\(v\text{.}\)</span> A car traveling at 50 miles per hour needs about 170 feet to stop.</p>
<p>Write a formula for <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> as a function of <span class="process-math">\(v\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Choose the appropriate graph, and label the axes.</p>
<p>What happens to the stopping distance if the velocity of the car is doubled?</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h4>
<p>The intensity, <span class="process-math">\(I\text{,}\)</span> of sound is proportional to the reciprocal of the square of the distance, <span class="process-math">\(d\text{,}\)</span> from its source.  In a certain auditorium, the sound intensity 6 meters from the stage is 100 watts per square meter.</p>
<p>Write a formula for <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> as a function of <span class="process-math">\(d\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Choose the appropriate graph, and label the axes.</p>
<p>What happens to the sound intensity if the distance from the stage is doubled?</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h4>
<p>The amount of energy, <span class="process-math">\(E\text{,}\)</span> generated by a windmill is proportional to the cube of the wind speed, <span class="process-math">\(v\text{.}\)</span> When the wind speed is 8 meters per second, the windmill generates 314 watts per square meter of energy.</p>
<p>Write a formula for <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> as a function of <span class="process-math">\(v\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Choose the appropriate graph, and label the axes.</p>
<p>What happens to the energy generated if the wind speed is doubled?</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(e)</span></h4>
<p>The speed, <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> of a tsunami is proportional to the square root of the depth, <span class="process-math">\(D\text{,}\)</span> of the ocean at that point.  At a depth of 25 meters, a tsunami travels at 15.65 meters per second.</p>
<p>Write a formula for <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> as a function of <span class="process-math">\(D\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Choose the appropriate graph, and label the axes.</p>
<p>What happens to the speed of the tsunami if the depth of the ocean is doubled?</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(f)</span></h4>
<p>The height, <span class="process-math">\(h\text{,}\)</span> of water in a conical storage tank is proportional to the cube root of the volume, <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> of the water.  If you pour 8 cubic feet of water into the tank, the water will reach a height of 3 feet.</p>
<p>Write a formula for <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> as a function of <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Choose the appropriate graph, and label the axes.</p>
<p>What happens to the height of the water if you double the volume of water you pour in?</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-5-6.html#activity-77" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
